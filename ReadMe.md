## Introduction

The **Music Library** project is designed to help users manage their music collections. Users can perform operations like adding new albums, updating album details, retrieving album information, and deleting unwanted records. The project is implemented with a modern web stack and follows best practices for API design and security.

This project is perfect for learning how to:
1. Build RESTful APIs.
2. Work with a database to store and query structured data.
3. Implement secure token-based authentication.
4. Create an interactive front-end or use API documentation tools like Swagger.

## Features

- **Album Management**:
  - Add, edit, delete, and retrieve albums.
  - Include metadata like title, artist, genre, release date, and record label.
  
- **Search Functionality**:
  - Query albums by title, artist, or genre.
  
- **Authentication**:
  - Secure access using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
  
- **API Documentation**:
  - Fully interactive documentation powered by Swagger/OpenAPI.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express.js (or your chosen framework)
  
- **Frontend** (optional if applicable):
  - React.js (or your chosen library/framework)
  
- **Database**:
  - MongoDB (or another database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL)
